# Rick and Morty Character Finder

## Project Overview
This project is a web application that allows users to explore characters from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty." Users can search for characters by name, species, type, status, and gender, and view detailed information about each character.

## Features
- **Character Search**: Search for characters by name, species, or type using a search input.
- **Status and Gender Filters**: Filter characters by status (Alive, Dead, Unknown) and gender (Male, Female, Genderless, Unknown) using dropdowns.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Character Cards**: Display detailed information about each character, including their image, status, species, gender, origin, location, and episode appearances.
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages when no characters match the search criteria or when an API error occurs.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling for the application, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for fetching and displaying character data, handling user interactions, and managing application state.

## Key Learnings
- **DOM Manipulation**: Learned how to dynamically create and update HTML elements using JavaScript.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented CSS media queries to ensure the application looks good on all screen sizes.
- **Event Handling**: Used JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as clicks and input changes.
- **API Integration**: Integrated with the Rick and Morty API to fetch character data.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling to provide feedback to users when something goes wrong.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the application.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file containing the main logic for fetching and displaying data.
- `render.js`: JavaScript module for rendering character data and managing error states.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.

## Future Improvements
- Add pagination to handle large sets of character data.
- Implement additional filters for more refined searches.
- Enhance the UI with animations and transitions for a more engaging user experience.

## Acknowledgments
